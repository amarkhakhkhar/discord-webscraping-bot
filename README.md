A discord bot made using JS that performs webScraping using "Puppeteer"  and performs following things: <br>
fetches random quote, fetches stock price from it's stock code, fetches sneaker price from it's name and provides url for buying

Steps to start: <br>
1. npm install<br>
2. Add your respective keys in config.json<br>
3. Then start "node index.js"<br>

Steps to test : <br>
After inviting bot to your server, you can write / and see following commands: <br>

/server -> which shows member in server
/user -> which shows who ran the command and when that user joined the server
/ping -> simply replies pong
/quotes -> for random quotes<br>
